Before to submit your pull-request:

- Be sure that the unit tests pass

- Avoid code duplication
- Small pull-requests are easier to review and can be merged quickly
- 1 pull-request == 1 feature/improvement
- Do not mix several kind of changes (e.g. a feature and a bug fix)
- Do not mix several features or improvements
- Do not mix several bug fixes
- Do not mix code style changes with reformatting and with functional changes
